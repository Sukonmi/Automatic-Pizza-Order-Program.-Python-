# 🎯OVERVIEW.
This is a Python syntax checkpoint that allows me to practices the skills I learnt in the Python syntax class.

# 📢DESCRIPTION.
I built an automatic pizza order program, that works out a customer's final bill based on the customer's order.

# ⚓INSTRUCTIONS.
- Open a new file in your Python development environment or IDE.
- Begin by typing the line 'Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries' which will display a welcome message when the code is run.
- Add a line that prompts the user for the size of the pizza they want using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'size'.
- Add a line that prompts the user if they want pepperoni on their pizza using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'add_pepperoni'.
- Add a line that prompts the user if they want extra cheese on their pizza using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'extra_cheese'.
- Check your code for any syntax errors or mistakes.
- Run the code and test it by providing inputs for size, pepperoni, and extra cheese.

# 🛠️TOOLS USED.
